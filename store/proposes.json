    "I wanna say I love you, I wanna hold you tight \nI want your arms around me & I want your lips on mine\nI wanna say I love you, but, babe I 'm terrified\nMy hands are shaking, my heart is racing\nCause it 's something I can't hide, it 's something I can't deny\nSo here I go.....\nBaby, I lo - o - o - ve you......",
    "I found the reason of my smile, the day I found you. Will you let me be the reason for your smile?",
    "You are the one I wanted to find, to tell that I need you all my life.",
    "Only you, you're the only thing I'll see forever. In my eyes, in my words, and in everything I do.",
    "Let’s spend the rest of our lives together.",
    "I want to grow old with you.",
    "I can’t imagine a life without you in it.",
    "Having you by my side is what completes me.",
    "Before I met you, I never realized how empty my life was.",
    "I now know that you and I are truly meant to be together.",
    "I wish I could give you everything, but I hope that this ring is enough.",
    "Will you give me your hand in marriage?",
    "Will you do me the honor of becoming my wife?",
    "Will you make me the happiest man alive?"
